## About

**Alison Melville's Shiatsu** needs a B2C website that showcases a massage business specialising in Shin Tai near Manchester. I designed the site to educate the user about the benefits of Shiatsu Shin Tai and allow them to contact her to book a consultation. 

I created the site to look professional and in keeping with the theme of similar Shiatsu websites and using the colour schemes to bring a relaxing impression as would be expected with a massage site. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential and existing clients.

The goal of the website will be to interact with existing and potential clients and be a source of information to educate them, build confidence and encourage them to contact the business owner.

The site must contain all information required to complete these goals and site visitors will most likely be comparing with other similar services in the local area so must stand out and show everything the user would want to see.
